<!-- Comments (shown in green in many editors) are ignored by the browser. They start with the text “less-than sign, exclamation mark, two hyphens” and end with “two hyphens, greater-than sign”. They’re typically used to leave notes or instructions for developers. In this lesson, I’ll use them to share information about the document. -->
